# opa_zoning
This code uses API and JSON functions to pull data about each neighborhood on the atlas.phila.gov website. Within the formed JSON file I located the district zoning code associated with each of the addresses in the uploaded csv file. I then created a function that adds a new column with the zoning codes that match each address and formed a new filtered csv file.
